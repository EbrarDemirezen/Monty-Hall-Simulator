# 🐐 Monty Hall Simulator – Gamifying the Monty Hall Problem 🐐

In this project, our goal is to create an interactive app/website designed to explore the famous probability puzzle known as the Monty Hall Problem. Inspired by the classic game show scenario, our aim is to give the users a chance to test their intuition, learn about probability, and have fun while doing it.

## 🧠 What is the Monty Hall Problem?

The Monty Hall Problem is a probability puzzle based on a game show scenario:

- You're on a game show with **3 closed doors**.
- Behind one door is a **car** (you win!), behind the other two are **goats**.
- You pick a door (say, Door 1).
- The host, Monty, who **knows what's behind each door**, opens one of the **other two doors**, always revealing a **goat**.
- Then he asks: **“Do you want to switch your choice or stay?”**

Intuitively, it feels like it doesn’t matter — but **switching actually doubles your chances** of winning (from 1/3 to 2/3).

## 🎯 Project Goal

To build a fun and educational application that simulates the Monty Hall problem, enabling users to:
* Visualize the outcomes of switching vs. staying
* Create a clean, responsive, and engaging UI
* Get a feel for how probability actually works by playing around with the game yourself

## 🛠 Tools Used

This project is primarily built with Java for core game logic and will be extended with web technologies to make it interactive and accessible via a browser.

* **Java** – Backend, the core logic of the Monty Hall simulation
* **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** – Frontend UI and interactive elements (to be decided)
* **GitHub** – Project planning, collaboration, and issue tracking
* **Libraries, frameworks** - (to be decided)

## 🚀 Installation & Usage

**Note:** This section will evolve as the project progresses.

Future Plans:
* An easy-to-use web-based interface

## 📌 Features Planned

* Interactive 3-door game interface
* Option to switch or stay
* Real-time stats tracker (win ratio for switch vs. stay)
* Game reset and retry options
* Clean animations (door opening) and visual feedback
* Sound effects
* A section explaining the logic behind the Monty Hall problem

## 📅 Weekly Milestones

We'll be using GitHub's **Issue Tracker** and **Milestones** to manage weekly development. 

## 🤝 Collaboration
This is a 2-person project developed for the DD1349 course at KTH.
